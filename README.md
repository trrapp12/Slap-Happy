### Rules of the Game:
---

1. The app starts by choosing a random word
2. The player can guess a single letter at a time
3. The player has a fixed number of turns in which to guess all of the letters in the word
4. The app should indicate when the player has won or lost

### This project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] Correct use of functions, conditionals, loops, arrays.
- [x] Properly sequence JavaScript statements.
- [x] Change the DOM based on application state (win/loss, valid/invalid guess).
- [x] Select a random word from a dictionary of words.
- [x] Display all guesses on the user's screen so the user knows what letters he/she has already guessed.
- [x] Display a visual indication for each letter in the word.
- [x] Display the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Decrement the number of turns remaining.
- [x] Display letters guessed in the position that they are contained in the word.
- [x] Include 
    a. GitHub Repo url, containing at least:
    b. index.html
    c. One or more CSS files (e.g. css/main.css)
    d. One or more JavaScript files (e.g. js/main.js)

### Ways I challenged myself:

---

- [x] Use JavaScript to trigger audio on state changes(i.e. win/lose).
- [x] Use onclick functionality to start game.
- [x] Incorporate video into CSS.
- [x] Refactor with @media query to make mobile ready
- [x] Responsive design
